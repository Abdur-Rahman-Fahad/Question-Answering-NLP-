<h1>ICT based Question Answering in Bengali Language using Transformer model </h1>

Question Answering (QA) is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves automatically generating answers to a question from a given context paragraph. A number of studies have been conducted on QA in high-resource languages like English, but very few have focused on resource-poor languages such as Bengali. This disparity stems from a lack of labeled data, a problem exacerbated by the enormous labor and time required to produce such datasets. In this work, we propose a Bengali dataset scraped from Higher Secondary and Intermediate level ICT textbooks of Bangladesh. We also introduce a simpler approach to QA that uses pre-trained transformer-based language models to generate answers from a given Bengali context passage and question. We specifically focused our domain on ICT (Information and Communication Technology), as no prior work exists in Bengali for this domain. Our system utilizes a transformer-based language model's ability to discern internal linguistic relationships within a paragraph. This allows the model to produce exact answers to specific questions based on the given context. We fine-tuned three transformer models: 1) BanglaT5, 2) mT5-base, and 3) mT5-large. The fine-tuned mT5-base model demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 78.7%, while the accuracy of mT5-large and BanglaT5 models was 75.8% and 72.7%, respectively.
